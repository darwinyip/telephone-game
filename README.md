# Telephone Game

This is a game of Telephone but instead of using people, it uses Google Translate to translate back and forth between English and a chain of random languages.

## How to play?

You will need to create your Google project with translate.googleapis.com enabled.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PROJECT_ID=<your google-project-id>
python telephone_game.py
```
